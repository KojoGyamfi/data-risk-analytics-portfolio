#  Case Study: Daily VaR & Risk Dashboard for a Multi-Asset Portfolio

---

##  Problem

Risk managers and analysts need accessible, transparent tools to evaluate portfolio risk in volatile market environments. Enterprise systems are often opaque or inflexible, making it difficult to simulate, explain, or customize risk metrics â€” especially for smaller firms or fast-moving asset classes like commodities and tech.

##  Solution

This project delivers a responsive, interactive Value-at-Risk (VaR) dashboard using **Python and Streamlit**. The tool enables users to:

- Calculate **Value at Risk (VaR)** using both:
  - **Historical VaR** (non-parametric percentile method)
  - **Parametric VaR** (z-score Ã— rolling volatility)
- Customize:
  - Portfolio asset selection (up to 5 tickers)
  - Asset weights (with real-time validation)
  - Confidence level (95% or 99%)
  - Rolling volatility window size
- Visualize:
  - Daily return distribution with VaR overlays
  - Rolling portfolio volatility
- Export risk reports as CSV summaries for documentation or reporting
